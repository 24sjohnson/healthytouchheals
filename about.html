                    <h2>About Shawna</h2>
                    <p>With three decades of experience in holistic health, education, and leadership, I'm honored to serve others through the art and science of therapeutic touch. As a Licensed Massage Therapist and Nationally Board-Certified Practitioner in Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork (BCTMB), my work blends evidence-based practice with heart-centered care.</p>
                    <p>My professional path has included roles as educator, mentor, and wellness leader—each rooted in one mission: to help individuals and communities thrive through integrative wellness. I've guided hundreds of clients toward relief, renewal, and personal growth through massage therapy, life coaching, and holistic education.</p>
                    <p>Today, through Healthy Touch Heals, I continue to serve with the same dedication and presence—supporting clients in stress reduction, pain relief, and emotional balance. Whether on a massage table, in a classroom, or during a wellness workshop, my goal is to create a compassionate and empowering space where healing and transformation unfold naturally.</p>
